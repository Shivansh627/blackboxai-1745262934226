# React Dummy API Website

## Project Overview
The **React Dummy API Website** is a simple web application built with React that interacts with a mock API to demonstrate API integration and routing capabilities. This project aims to showcase how to set up a React application with routing and manage components effectively.

## Installation
To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-dummy-api-website.git
   cd react-dummy-api-website
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

After running the above command, the application should open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can navigate through the different routes defined in the app. The application is designed to reflect a dynamic user interface, where you can see how components are organized and how to fetch data from a dummy API.

To build the app for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Features
- **React Router:** Easily navigate between pages without reloading the application.
- **Dynamic Components:** Components update seamlessly as you interact with the app.
- **Development Server:** Uses a local server for rapid development and testing.
- **Responsive Design:** Basic styling structure that responds to different device sizes.
